# Placeholder Documentation: WindowCoordinator Cleanup

> **Purpose:** Documents any intentional placeholder/scaffolding code in the codebase that is part of planned features for this task. Per project conventions, we use centralized placeholder files instead of in-code TODO comments. Updated as implementation progresses.

---

No placeholders introduced yet. This file will be updated if any are added during implementation.
