## Status

- Research complete: captured SwiftUI sizing issues, NSWindow resizing gaps, and playlist constraints from both native and `webamp_clone` sources.
- Plan defined (see `plan.md`) outlining how to answer all four regression questions.

## Next

- Provide final written analysis:
  - Modifier order + `.fixedSize()` guidance for Main/EQ windows.
  - Docking logic + playlist adjustment strategy.
  - Updated `resizeMainAndEQWindows` sample implementation.
  - Playlist min/max validation with citations.
