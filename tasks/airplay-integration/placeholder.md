# Placeholder: AirPlay Integration

> **Purpose:** Documents intentional placeholder/scaffolding code in the codebase that is part of the AirPlay feature. Per project conventions, we use centralized placeholder.md files instead of in-code TODO comments.

**Date:** 2026-02-07
**Status:** No placeholders yet (implementation not started)

---

## Active Placeholders

None yet. This file will be updated during implementation if any placeholder code is introduced.

---

## Rules

1. NO `// TODO` comments in production code
2. Document placeholders here with file:line, purpose, status, and action
3. Review during task completion - remove or implement all placeholders

## Template

```
