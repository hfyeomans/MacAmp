# Placeholder: WinampPlaylistWindow Layer Decomposition

> **Purpose:** Documents intentional placeholder/scaffolding code in the codebase that is part of this task. Per project conventions, we use centralized placeholder.md files instead of in-code TODO comments.

## Placeholder Code

None. All phases completed cleanly without requiring scaffolding placeholders.

The phased approach (create new files first, then wire and delete) avoided the need for temporary parallel methods.
