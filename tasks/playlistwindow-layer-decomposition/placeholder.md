# Placeholder: WinampPlaylistWindow Layer Decomposition

> **Purpose:** Documents intentional placeholder/scaffolding code in the codebase that is part of this task. Per project conventions, we use centralized placeholder.md files instead of in-code TODO comments.

---

## Placeholder Code

_None yet. Will be populated during implementation if scaffolding is needed._

## Expected Placeholders

During the extraction phases, temporary parallel methods may exist briefly:
- Old extension methods alongside new child view structs (during Phase 2 transition)
- These should be removed in Phase 3 when the root composer is rewritten
