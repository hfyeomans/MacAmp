# Phase 8.6 AudioEngineController Analysis - Plan

1. Map AudioPlayer engine responsibilities and estimate extraction size using current line references.
2. Identify coupling points and Swift 6 concurrency concerns that raise extraction risk.
3. Evaluate benefits vs. current 1,059-line size and propose lower-risk alternatives.
4. Recommend whether to proceed with 8.6 and whether Phase 9 should be prioritized.
