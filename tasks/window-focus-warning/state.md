# Current State

- Documented the key-window warning and its likely cause (borderless style mask) in `research.md`.
- Drafted a plan outlining style-mask adjustments and fallback options in `plan.md`.
- Attempted a `.titled` style-mask prototype in `configureWindow(_:)`, but reverted due to visual regression (title bar reappeared); the task remains open for a future solution, likely alongside the multi-window docking work.
