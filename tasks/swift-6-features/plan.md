# Plan - Swift 6 Features Overview

## Objective
Explain Swift 6 key improvements for the MacAmp team with emphasis on:
1. Concurrency & actor isolation updates
2. Strict concurrency checking mechanics
3. Other language-level enhancements
4. Breaking changes relative to Swift 5
5. Migration tactics relevant to existing macOS apps

## Steps
1. Summarize concurrency/actor updates using research bullets; highlight how they improve safety.
2. Detail strict concurrency enforcement, including compiler diagnostics and Sendable requirements.
3. Outline broader language improvements (typed throws, variadic generics, macros, C++ interop, embedded Swift) relevant to MacAmp.
4. Enumerate notable breaking changes vs Swift 5.x along with examples developers will see.
5. Provide migration strategies (tooling flags, annotation patterns, auditing process) referencing MacAmp practices.
6. Review the synthesized answer for clarity and alignment with research, ensuring no contradictory statements.
