# Plan

1. Write `docs/context/xcode-testing-context.md` summarizing the MacAmp test setup with emphasis on concurrency tests and how to run them.
2. Include commands, locations, and guidance for adding new concurrency tests to the test plan.
3. Record completion in `tasks/xcode-testing-context/state.md`.
