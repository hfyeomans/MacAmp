# Current State

- Completed research into the `NSOpenPanel` menu flow regression and captured findings in `research.md`.
- Produced a plan outlining how to evaluate architecture alignment and the relationship between the concurrency bug and the `AVAudioFile` error (`plan.md`).
- Defined implementation checkpoints in `todo.md`; first two items now complete.
- Created working branch `swift-modernization-analysis-fix` from `swift-modernization-recommendations`.
- Implemented main-actor dispatch restoration and unified file-picker logic across playlist and main window pickers; only post-fix validation remains.
