# Plan - Oracle Validation (AudioPlayer Refactor)

1. Verify Audio Engine component counts/LoC against actual files.
2. Confirm reduction metric is present and consistent with current AudioPlayer line count.
3. Check API naming for EQ preset save method against documentation.
4. Verify sample rate language uses "from file format" and no 48kHz references remain.
5. Confirm VideoPlaybackController layer classification says Mechanism layer.
6. Summarize verification status and highlight any mismatches before approval.
