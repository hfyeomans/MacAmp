## High Priority Actionable Tasks (Sprint S1)

These are the Sprint S1 HIGH priority tasks, ready to act on:

1. **`spm-multiple-producers-fix`** — Blocks `swift test` via CLI for ALL tasks. Do first for testability.
2. **`audioplayer-decomposition` Phase 4** — UNLOCKED by T7. Engine transport extraction, reduces AudioPlayer to <600 lines.
3. **`network-auto-reconnect`** — Stream resilience for unified pipeline. Medium effort.
4. **`xcode-butterchurn-webcontent-diagnosis`** — Diagnosis complete, needs signing/entitlements implementation.

**Architecture policy note:** `swift-project-structure-research` is the approved placement-policy reference for Sprint S1. Do not run a big-bang repo restructure during S1.
