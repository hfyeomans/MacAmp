# State

- Research complete; plan executed.
- Identified one functional risk: `showOptionsMenu` relies on `NSApp.keyWindow`, so the Control+O shortcut positions the menu relative to whichever window is key (playlist, equalizer) instead of the main window.
- Noted a minor copy issue: O button tooltip still references "Ctrl+T" despite the Control+O shortcut.
- No further actions taken; waiting to deliver review feedback.
