# State: Five-Window Documentation Guidance

- Research captured from architecture/implementation docs plus the Video and Milkdrop window source files (`research.md`).
- Plan defined for producing doc-topology decisions, outlines, and README guidance (`plan.md`).
- Next action: communicate the guidance (doc placement decisions, outlines, README instructions) back to the user so they can implement the updates.
