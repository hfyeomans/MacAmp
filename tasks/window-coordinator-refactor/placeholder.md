# Placeholder / Scaffolding Code Tracker

> **Purpose:** Document any intentional placeholder or scaffolding code introduced during the refactoring. Per project conventions, we use this centralized file instead of in-code TODO comments.

## Rules
1. NO `// TODO` comments in production code
2. Document placeholders here with file:line, purpose, status, and action
3. Review during task completion - remove or implement

## Active Placeholders

| File:Line | Purpose | Status | Action |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
| (none yet) | | | |

---

*Updated as refactoring progresses.*
