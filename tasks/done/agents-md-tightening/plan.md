# Plan: Tighten Project AGENTS.md

1. Create backup of existing project `AGENTS.md` with `.hfy.backup` suffix.
2. Replace project `AGENTS.md` with a concise structure:
   - Skill-first trigger
   - Swift/macOS-first priorities
   - Tool routing (short form)
   - Required task artifacts
   - Placeholder/deprecated policy
   - XcodeGen and Xcode project rules
   - XcodeBuildMCP and Gemini usage triggers
   - PR comment workflow trigger
   - Compact TS/JS standards reference
3. Validate file readability and ensure all critical triggers from research are retained.
4. Record implementation status in `state.md`.
