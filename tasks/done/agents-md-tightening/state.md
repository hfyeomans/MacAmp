# State: AGENTS.md Tightening and User-Level Sync

## Current Status
- Project `AGENTS.md` tightened and condensed.
- Project backup preserved at `/Users/hank/dev/src/MacAmp/AGENTS.md.hfy.backup`.
- User-level `AGENTS.md` synced with the full backed-up content from project.

## User-Level Sync Actions
- Backed up user-level file:
  - `/Users/hank/.codex/AGENTS.md.hfy.backup`
- Promoted full historical project guidance into user-level file:
  - `/Users/hank/.codex/AGENTS.md`
- Validation:
  - line count moved from 52 to 747
  - byte-for-byte match with `/Users/hank/dev/src/MacAmp/AGENTS.md.hfy.backup`

## Notes
- This preserves all previously removed long-form triggers at the user level while keeping project-level AGENTS concise.

## User-Level Tightening Pass (2026-02-25)
- Created fresh user-level backup before tightening:
  - `/Users/hank/.codex/AGENTS.md.20260225-224745.hfy.backup`
- Rewrote `/Users/hank/.codex/AGENTS.md` to a compact version while preserving trigger coverage.
- Line count reduced from 747 to 200.
- Retained trigger categories:
  - skill-first workflow
  - shell tool routing and `sg` structural-search rule
  - PR thread resolution script workflow
  - deprecated/legacy removal policy
  - Gemini large-context usage and `@` path syntax
  - TypeScript/JavaScript standards
  - full multi-step task workflow with task artifacts
  - Swift/XcodeGen/Xcode docs/Swift standards guidance
