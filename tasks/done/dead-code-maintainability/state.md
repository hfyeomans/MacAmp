# Current State

- Removed unused `MacAmpApp/Views/DockingContainerView.swift` and cleaned Xcode project entries to eliminate the final duplicate window implementation flagged in sections 5.1 and 5.3.
- Updated `tasks/code-duplication-analysis/README.md` to mark the high-maintainability and high-complexity duplication items as resolved (dated Oct 24 2025).
- Verified the original TODO "Implement eject logic" is now satisfied by the concrete `AudioPlayer.eject()` implementation introduced earlier; no TODO remains.
- Ready to report findings and rebuild with Xcode for verification.
