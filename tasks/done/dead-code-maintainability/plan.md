# Plan

1. Remove the unused `DockingContainerView.swift` implementation and associated Xcode project references to eliminate the remaining duplicate window path flagged in sections 5.1/5.3.
2. Update documentation (tasks/code-duplication-analysis/README.md) to reflect the resolved duplication impact so the analysis stays current.
3. Confirm the prior eject TODO was implemented and summarize status for reporting.
4. Rebuild with Xcode to ensure a clean build after changes.
