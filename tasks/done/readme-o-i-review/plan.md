# Plan - README O/I Button Verification

1. Confirm keyboard shortcut coverage in `AppCommands.swift`, noting control-based shortcuts that exist and highlighting any missing ones referenced by README.
2. Inspect Options menu implementation in `WinampMainWindow.swift` to verify available actions, shortcut annotations, and state handling.
3. Review `TrackInfoView.swift` to validate fields shown for local tracks versus streams and compare with README narrative.
4. Cross-check README sections (Key Features, Options Menu, Double Size, Always On Top, Track Information, Clutter Bar, Keyboard Shortcuts, UI Enhancements, Release Notes) against implementation findings.
5. Document discrepancies, accuracy assessment, and recommendations for README alignment.
