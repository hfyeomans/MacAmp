# State

- Research complete: Codex MCP does not emit `conversation_id` values in responses, causing downstream `codex-reply` attempts to fail when they expect a UUID.
- CLI documentation reviewed; no configuration surfaced for enabling multi-turn conversations over MCP.
- Pending: craft final explanation & recommendations for coordinating multiple agents with Codex MCP.
