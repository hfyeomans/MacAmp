# Deprecated: Balance Bar Color Fix

> **Purpose:** Documents any deprecated or legacy code discovered during this task. Per project conventions, deprecated code is removed rather than marked with comments, and findings are recorded here.

---

## Findings

None identified yet. The `calculateBalanceFrameOffset()` function will be replaced, not deprecated - the old logic is simply incorrect and will be removed.
